# Things to keep in mind for all future users
1. SLOW DOWN! At the time point we built the car, this car values around $5000 and 100+ hours work. The Hokuyo LiDar is $1600, Jetson without SSD and Wifi module is $600, VESC is $300. Therefore, SLOW DOWN and be CAREFUL! We fully understand robotics guys are "crazy" like us. :)
2. Check the environment first. Avoid GLASS, CHAIRS, ANYTHING IT MIGHT GO UNDER! Those things are Lidar killer, because Lidar is using light and it is almost a 2D sensor. 
3. Understand what are you doing and what will happen. Simulation is your best friend! If something didn't work on simulation, it would not work in reality. If the behavior is totally different with your expection, you need to study more!
