This repository hosts a Yolo V5-based object detection system designed to identify obstacles and measure their distance from the origin in a vehicle's coordinate system, as well as the width of the obstacles. Utilizing the Intel RealSense D415 depth camera, the system provides accurate depth information that is integrated with the object detection capabilities of Yolo V5 to enhance autonomous navigation tasks and environmental awareness for robotic applications.
